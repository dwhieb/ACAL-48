            <h2>Prosody as Cohesion</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>helps listeners to detect discourse boundaries, and the degree of cohesion or discontinuity between successive utterances</li>
              <li>structure (whether phonological or syntactic) is always cohesion-forming</li>

          </section>

          <section>
            <strong>This study shows how prosodic features are used by speakers to lend cohesion to their discourse, by signaling the transitions from one unit of discourse to the next, the relations that hold between those units, and their relative prominence.</strong>

              <li>each step in the complicating action is followed by a long pause, creating a slower narrative pacing</li>

            <li><dfn>Isotony</dfn> or <dfn>intonational parallelism</dfn> is the realization of the same intonational contour on separate, typically successive, stretches of speech.</li>

        <section class=image-section>

          <section class=section-content>
            <p>Problems determining pitch reset:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>canonical cases of pitch reset are rare in the Ékegusií corpus</li>
              <li>terminal contours or prosodic accent may interrupt declination trends</li>
              <li>pitch may reset down rather than up</li>
              <li>many utterances show a flat contour or even a gradual rise</li>
              <li>reported speech consistency shows a higher register</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <img src=img/reset.png alt='spectrograph showing pitch reset over a series of utterances'>

          <section>
            <p><strong>Pitch reset is best understood as a more holistic property of how hearers perceive phrases, abstracting away from the parts of the pitch contour that are irrelevant to the overall trend.</strong></p>

      <section id=contour class=section>
        <h1 class=section-header>Intonational Contour</h1>

        <section class=section-content>
          <p>Ékegusií has many types of intonational contours, each with a dedicated function. Classifying these contours as simply H or L, or falling or rising, fails to capture important differences between them. Some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>sharp terminal rise:</strong> backgrounding function, for conditionals, new topics, and ‘when’-clauses</li>
            <li><strong>gradual terminal rise:</strong> continuing topic, more information to come</li>
            <li><strong>high level register:</strong> extended sequences of events</li>
            <li><strong>sharp fall to low register:</strong> conclusion of sequence of events</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Speakers attend to the overall, conventionalized pattern of the intonational contour, rather than individual pitch targets.</strong></p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <!-- END INTONATIONAL CONTOUR -->

      <section id=conclusion class=section>
        <h1 class=section-header>Conclusion</h1>

        <section class=section-content>
          <p>
            Each prosodic feature helps delineate units of discourse and convey their relationship to the units around them. These features work in tandem to create stronger or weaker breaks in the discourse, thereby creating hierarchical prosodic structure.
